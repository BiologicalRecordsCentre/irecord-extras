# irecord-extras
A small Drupal module to provide iRecord-specific functionality

INSTALLATION
1. Copy the module to your Drupal modules folder on iRecord.
2. Enable the module.

WHAT IT DOES
1. Looks for a field called field_o13 on user registration form and makes it mandatory on that form. In Drupal UI the field should be non-mandatory so that it is not mandatory on other forms.
